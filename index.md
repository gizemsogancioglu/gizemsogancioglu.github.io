## Bio

I am currently a Postdoc at UMC Utrecht. I pursued my PhD at the Social and Affective Computing Group, Department of Information and Computing Sciences, Utrecht University, under the supervision of Heysem Kaya and Albert Ali Salah. During my PhD, I explored the challenges of implementing fairness and XAI methods in the context of mental health and proposed solutions to address some of these significant challenges.

I received my B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees from the Computer Engineering Departments of Hacettepe University and Bogazici University, respectively. After completing my masterâ€™s studies, I worked as an NLP Research Engineer in two different companies for approximately five years.

Currently, for my postdoctoral project, I am collaborating with researchers, data scientists, engineers, and clinical experts to develop treatment outcome prediction models within a federated architecture for psychiatry research.
