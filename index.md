## Bio

I'm an Assistant Professor at [Social and Affective Computing Group](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/interaction/social-and-affective-computing), Department of Information and Computing Sciences at Utrecht University. Prior to joining UU, I was an Assistant Professor at the Department of Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence at Tilburg University. I was previously a Postdoctoral Researcher at Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University working with Jeffrey Cohn, a Postdoctoral Researcher at Affect Analysis Group, University of Pittsburgh and a visiting Ph.D. student at Pattern Recognition and Bioinformatics Group, TU Delft. I received my B.Sc., M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees from Computer Engineering Department at Middle East Technical University.
